        <h2>The Tick and Epsilon Role Playing System</h2>
      </div>
	<h4 id="stats">Character Stats</h4>
	<p>
		There are three character stats in this system: strength, dexterity, and intelligence.  At initial character creation, you have 40 points to distribute amongst your stats. During the initial distribution, the maximum amount of points you can put into any given stat is 18.  Later on, other bonuses may be used to increase or decrease your stats further, there is no hard cap after initial character creation.  The stat itself will have relatively little meaning; however, the stat will translate to a modifier (positive or negative).  Almost every roll you make will be effected by at least one stat modifier.    
	</p>
	<p>
		Stat Bonus Formula: (Stat_Value-10)/2
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, a character with the stats of Strength: 10, Dexterity: 18, and Intelligence: 18 will have a stength modifier of 0 and dexterity and intelligence bonuses of +4.  The modifiers can also be negative, for instance, an intelligence of 6 has a modifier of -2.
	</p>
	<h4 id="level">Character Creation</h4>
	<p>
		At first level a character has 35 points (plus any bonus points from flaws) to build his character. Every level after that he gets 15 more (35 at first, 50 at second, 65 at third, etc.) A character also has 5 + his level ticks to use each round in combat and he starts with 20(called the kicker) + 4 + str mod hp. Every level after he gains 4 + str mod hp. In addition to ticks, points and hp a character also recieves 1 + int mod skill points every level (min 1).<br/>
		Building a character is simple, spend your points to buy abilities. Any points not used are saved and can be used at the next level up.
	</p>
	<h4 id="dodge">Avoiding Attacks and Armor</h4>
	<p>
		Attacks are avoided by either a dodge roll or a shield block roll.  Failing that, armor serves to reduce the damage you receive when hit.  For example, plate mail provides 8 damage reduction against physical attacks. Armor is broken down into four broad categories.  This simplifies their stats.
	</p>
        <div class="col-md-6">
        	<table class="table table-striped">
            		<thead>

        </div>
	<h5>Dodge</h5>
	<p>
		A character’s total dodge bonus is equal to the sum of the characters  dodge bonus, dexterity bonus, armor penalty (these will be negative), and miscellaneous modifiers from abilities. To dodge, the defending characters rolls a d20 and adds the total dodge bonus to the roll. If this value exceeds the the offensive character’s attack roll then the attacking character misses.
	</p>
	<h5>Shield Block</h5>
	<p>
		A character’s total shield block bonus is equal to the sum of the character’s shield roll bonus, strength bonus, and miscellaneous modifiers from the shield. In order to block an attack with your shield your character rolls a d20 and adds the total shield block bonus to the roll. If this value exceeds the offensive character’s attack roll then the attacking character misses. A shield block may only be attempted if the attacking character is within ±90 ◦ of the front of the defending character.
	</p>
	<h5>Flank Attacks</h5>
	<p>
		If the defending character is being flanked by the attacking character then the attacking character automatically hits if the defending character lacks uncanny dodge. If the defending character has uncanny dodge, he rolls a dodge or shield block normally though the attacking character gets a +2 to hit.
	</p>
	<p>
		A character is considered to be flanked by an attacker in any of the following scenarios: his back or side is to the attacker, he is unaware of his assailant, or if the character is engaged with a different attacker and either does not turn to face the new attacker or is unable to do so.
	</p>
	<h4 id="attack">Attack Roll</h4>
	<p>
		Attack roll bonus is calculated as Attack Roll Bonus = Base Attack Bonus + Average(Strength and Dex modifiers) + Miscellaneous modifiers (enchanted weapons, flank, etc)
	</p>
	<p> When using a ranged weapon, strength does not factor into the attack roll bonus.  Instead of taking the average of your strength and dexterity modifiers, just use your dexterity modifier. </p>
	<p> When using a weapon with two-hands, use half the strength modifier (rounded down) when calculating your attack roll bonus.  In exchange for the reduced accuracy, you double your strength modifier to damage. </p>

	<h4 id="saves">Saving Throws</h4>
	<h5>Poison</h5>
	<p>Poison saves are handled by making a strength check (1d20+strength modifier).  The difficulty of the strength check is up to the DM, but in general a weak poison would have a difficulty of roughly between 8 and 10.  A difficulty of 17+ would constitute an extremely strong poison.</p>
	<h5>Reflex</h5>
	<p>Reflex saves are handled by reflex rolls. For instance, a reflex roll is made if someone uses matter magic to attempt to drop a large rock on  someone. however, a character can never dodge, for example, a fire blast. A save vs. spell must be made here. A reflex roll is calculated as 1d20+reflex bonus+dexterity modifier+miscellaneous modifiers(bonuses from items, masteries, specializations, etc).</p>
	<h5>Save vs. Spell</h5>
	<p>The only true saving throw now is Save vs. Spell. Any magic targeting a character warrants that character having an opportunity to resist the spell. This is simply done with a Save vs. Spell. The difficulty checks of these spells will be covered under the section on Magic Rules. </p>
	<p>A character’s saves are calculated as (⅛*willpower) (rounded down) + purchased saves + intelligence modifier + miscellaneous modifiers (from items, masteries, etc).</p>
	<h4 id="rounds">Rounds, Segments, and Ticks</h4>
	<p>Perhaps the most radical shift from a conventional game of D&D are the changes to the flow of combat itself. The first thing to note is that rounds are no longer 6 second self contained intervals where each participant gets one action. The old rules, for the most part, restricted opponents to standing in place and trading blows. We now view the round as a container. Think of it as segments occur during rounds and ticks occur during segments.</p>
	<p>To clarify further, when a character’s initiative is actually called, this is referred to as that character’s segment. Ticks are the bread and butter of the new system. Every round a character has 5 + level ticks to use. Every action a character takes requires a certain amount of ticks. Finally, unused ticks do not roll over from round to round. They simply disappear as a lost opportunity. </p>
	<p>A character may act outside of his segment.  This is the epsilon part of the tick and epsilon system.  Many combat moves/abilities/spells will have an associated epsilon value.  An ability with an epsilon value can be used up to the epsilon value segments prior to your segment.  It may also be used anytime after your segment. This is assuming you have the ticks that is.  Further, these abilities may be used "in response" to an action.  A move used in response to another cannot be responded to by the person who's ability is being reacted to.  We don't want to have to put moves on a stack and resolve them one by one.</p>
	<p>To illustrate, Bob uses the frenzy charge ability to attack Frank.  Frank's initiative is only 2 after Bob.  Frank also has the improved trip ability.  This ability has an epsilon value of 5.  Since Frank still has all of his ticks for the round, he can chose to spend 3 of his ticks to attempt to trip Bob before his frenzy charge lands.  If he successfully trips Bob, Bob would suffer the effects of the trip.  In this case, knocking Bob down would interrupt his frenzy charge and cause him to lose the 8 ticks he spent on it.  If Frank's trip attempt fails, Bob's frenzy charge will complete normally. </p>
	<p>In addition, a character may also hold his action or perform a premeditated action.  Holding an action means to spend some or all of a characters ticks at a later segment.  However, when performaing a premeditated action, a character must give up all of his ticks for that round.  In return for this sacrifice, he is prepped and ready to go first the next round.  His initiaitive will be automatically calcualted as the minimum initiative that round minus his dexterity modifier, guarenteeing that he will go first.</p>
	<h3>Magic Systems</h3>
	<h4 id="ritualmagic">Ritual Magic</h4>
	<p>The current magic system available to PCs.  This system is much more similar to a traditional D&D magic system.  It requires the caster to learn the spells before hand etc.  This magic system, however, instead of focusing quick chants and spells cast in seconds is instead a more traditionally occult system.</p>
	<p>The spells generally take at least 10 minutes to cast and are heavily focused on summoning and binding.  There exists a list of currently created rituals and their rules; however, the player is still encouraged to try making their own. </p>
	<h5>Will Power</h5>
	<p>Will power is a calculated stat used to determine how strong or effective a particular ritual is.  It’s calculated as follows:
WillPower = Level + Intelligence Modifier + Purchliased Will Power + External Modifiers.  
(External Modifiers may come from magic items, other rituals, assisting wizards, etc.  Consult DM for specifics if unsure in a given situation)</p>
	<p>Will power may be purchased at the cost of 5 level up points apiece.  There is no cap on how many can be purchased (aside from your available points to spend of course).</p> 
	<p>Will power comes with a few perks you can activate as your rank goes up.</p>

	<h5>Learning New Rituals</h5>
	<p>Your character may acquire new rituals in three ways.  The first is the natural progression of your character.  This is given in the following chart.  Second, provided you are of sufficient rank, you may learn a ritual from another ritualist.  Finally, you may spend points at level up for additional rituals.  It costs 1 point to learn any two rituals of Rank I-V.  It costs 1 point for a single ritual of Rank VI-X.</p>

	<h4 id="voodoo">Voodoo</h4>
		<p>
			Voodoo is an ability that can be purchased that is powered by willpower. It costs 10 points. Voodoo allows the caster to "bind" two objects together using one of the following three bindings:
		</p>
		<p class="half">
			Transfer Properties<br/>
				Each transfer properties binding creates a one-directional link that copies one property of one object to another. For example, one may bind a piece of chalk to a piece of metal using a transfer propery binding and give the metal the brittleness of the chalk.
		</p>
		<p class="half">
			Stability<br/>
			A stability binding is a two-way binding. Moving one object moves the other and resistance to one also applies to another. You cannot move one object without the other object also moving. For example, you might bind a fighter's breast plate to a boulder. Preventing him from moving if the boulder is suffciently heavy. A sufficiently skilled user of voodoo might bind the actual person tot he rock.
		</p>
		<p class="half">
			Unto one as the other<br/>
			A link of this type is bidirectional. Quite literally anything that one object undergoes the other does as well. For Example, if two people are bound in this fasion, if one dies so does the other. If one sustains hp damage so does the other. Same for healing, regeneration, burns, pain, etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			Voodoo has 4 ranks, each requiring a minimum will power. At each rank you can perform more difficult bindings.<br/>
			Rank 1 requires willpower rank 3 and you can connect "Like" non living things<br/>
			Rank 2 requires willpower rank 4 and you can connect "Non Like" non living things<br/>
			Rank 3 requires willpower rank 5 and you can connect "Like" living things<br/>
			Rank 4 requires willpower rank 6 and you can connect "non like" living things
		</p>
		<p>
			 Some other notes about voodoo:<br/>
			A user of voodoo may maintain 1 binding per will power.<br/>
			Casting a voodoo binding costs the caster hp equal to the willpower rank required to cast the binding.<br/>
			The tick cost for laying a voodoo binding is equal to the required willpower rank of the binding.<br/>
			The saving throw to resist voodoo is equal to 0.5*caster willpower + required willpower rank.
	<h4 id="freemagic">Free Magic</h4>
		<p>
			Traditional D&D magic systems, with their well defined spell system, quickly stagnates a wizard's gameplay. What follows is a free form spell casting system such that no two spells need be the same. The idea is that the system provides boundaries and guidelines for what is capable while the wizard, himself, must provide the details.
		</p>
		<p><b>NOTE:</b>Currently, free magiic can only be use by Angel/Demon summons from withing the ritual magic system. We may reopen purchasing free magic to PC's at a later time. These rules are still useful as the PC may easily have dominated an Angel/Demon.

			Rank<br/>
			For each spell school there exists 5 levels of profinciency. We call them ranks. There are attained by placing, at level up, additional points in nkowledge of a spell sphere. The breakdown is rank 1 at knowledge 1, rank 2 at knowledge 2, rank 3 at knowledge 6, rank 4 at knowledge 12 and rank 5 at knowledge 18.
		</p>
		<p class="half">
			Calculating rank is not difficult, though sometimes, a judgement call by the DM is required. To calculate the rank of a spell one needs to consider two things: the target and the complexity of the effect. Each of these will have a rank associated with them. The final rank of the spell is simple the higher of the two. <br/>
			Target is the easier of the two to calculate as it has no subjective qualities. The rank based on the target is described in the chart below:
		</p>	
		<p class="half">
			Next is the complexity. This one tends to be a little fuzzier. It runs roughly as follows:<br/>
			Complexity 1 is for wild, uncontrolled bursts of magic, for instance a burst of shielding force with no duration, a fireball, crumbling a wall. There are all effects of complexity 1.<br/>
			Complexity 2 runs from effects with any kind of structure at all such as mold-ing a chair out of stone (using matter) to as complex as basic telekinesis(arcane). Some examples include: solidfying the air around you to act as a barrier to sound (elemental), summoning a box of stone around a target (matter), and breaking down the "magical glue" binding something together(void).<br/>
			Complexity 3 runs from conjuring clockwork machinery(matter) to modifying the structure of living things(life). Further examples include: healing(life), increasing your strength(life), keening a weapon(matter), adding a "plus" to a weapon/armor(matter), reading someone's thoughts(mind), projecting your mind from your body(mind), using the water in the air to bend light around(elemental), "subtracting" bits from existing magic(void), extending an existing spell from another willing wizard(arcane), laying down a magical "trigger"(arcane).<br/>
			Complexity 4 runs on the order of manipulating raw magical energy(arcane) to completely polymorphing a living creature(life). Further examples include: forcibly ripping mana out of a another target(arcane), reworking the structure of a material to make it better able to hold larger enchantments(matter), regenerate a lost limb(life), create a sentience with limited awareness/computational powers(mind), cutting off a person's access to magic(void).<br/>
			Complexity 5 magic allows spells of boundless complexity. The only limits at rank 5 are the casters creativity and his draw.
		</p>
		<p class="half">
			Mana<br/>
			A character's total mana is equal to (3 + int_mod)* level. A character's mana may be further modified by special abilities. The mana cost of a spell is affected by just a small number of things. The procedure is as follows:<br/>
			Calculate the rank of the spell, that is the base cost (rank 3 spells start at mana cost 3).<br/>
			Next decide on duration. The longer the duration the more it will cost. It duration increase increases the cost by 1. They are all 1 something/level. The order is round, minute, hour, day, week, month, year, permanent. So if you want to make something last for 1 hour per level that will cost 3 extra mana fir duration while to make something permanent it costs 8.<br/>
			Many spells will require additional mana to fuel them. Generally speaking, every point of mana spent in this regard will give you one iteration of the effect. For instance consider conjuring a burst of fire with no duration. The rank is 2 because it is  rank 1 for an uncontrolled burst but rank 2 for an external, non-sentiant, and single target so the final rank is 2. Now the damage for this burst of fire depends on how much mana you pump into the effect. For each additional point of mana it increases it by 2d6. So spending 6 mana (2 for rank and 4 more for damage) you will get an 8d6 fire burst. Any effect with a "pumpable effect works in s similar fashion. Here a few more examples to drive the point home: Using life 3 to increase strength cast 3 + duration + 1 mana per strength. Using life to increase movement is the same except it is 1 mana per 10 ft of movement speed increase. The exact increment of each point is something that is determined by the DM (for balance). However, many of these effects have become quite ubiquitous over time and a kind of standardiztion has arose.<br/>
			Finially, you must consider area of effect. Now if the spell is local to a single target ther is no cost. Further, if the spell is targeting multiple individuals targets then you add 1 to the casting for each target beyond the first. The other aspect of area effect spells is for a spell that doesn't contain specific targets but actually affects a spherical area. This adds 1 to the mana cost for each 5 ft. of the radius of the ball you want to affect. For example, If you wanted to snap a sword in half using matter, you would calculate it in the following fashion. First, we have a single non-sentient target and the spell effect is crude, it indicates a rank 2 for targeting and a rank 2 for complexity so it is rank 2. The spell has no duration and no area because it is just one specific target so the final cost is 2. Now say you wanted to break 5 swords with the same spell. The calculation is different. Complexity is still the same but it is multiple non-sentient targets so targeting is 4 so the rank and base cost is 4. Still no duration but you pay 1 additional mana for each sword beyond the first so 4 more. Therefore the final cost is 8, which is cheaper than if you wanted to cast the lower rank version 5 times. Do note that is not always true. Take the 2 swords example, it would cast 4 to cast it twice but 5 to cast it once. Just because you can doesn't always mean you should.<br/>
			The other aspect of targeting is area cost in the sphereical method. So, if instead of targeting individual objects such as swords, we wante to instead conjure a huge ball of fire. So there are 5 enemies on the field. Let's pretend first that they are clustered together so they all fit in a 10 ft. sphere. Then we can hit them with a single fireball by increasing the radius by 2 points since each point increases the radius by 5ft. With no points in radius you can still effect a small area (enough to hit one target). The other method would be to summon 5 individual bursts of fire, one for each target. That would require 4 mana for targeting and increase the rank to 4(the reason it is 4 and not 5 is subtle).
		</p>
		<p class="half">
			Advanced technique: Mixing Spheres<br/>
			Some effects are best accomplished by mixing spheres. Basically, the rank of a mixed spell is the max of the complexity/target rank or each sphere plus 1 per each sphere above the first. For example:<br/>
			Consider setting an alarm. We want a very loud boom of noise to occur anytime magic goes off withing 15' of yourself. So, detect magic is a complexity 1 arcane effect and 1 for targeting since you are targeting yourslef. Creating noise using wind would be elemental 2 for targeting and 1 for complexity. We are mixing 2 spheres so the rank is 2 for the max of the effects plus 1 for mixing so the final rank is 3. Now to calculate mana cost we need to decide on duration (lets assume day/level is enough) and area for the detect effect (15 ft. should be good) so the casting cost would be 3(rank) + 5(duration) and 3(area) = 11.

			The item has an internal mana equal to 5 times it’s rank.  This is refilled daily at midnight.
			Named summons will be stronger, though also harder to bind in.

			Binding an elemental into an item grants the item an elemental specific power.  The power of the item is proportional to the power of the elemental.  The effect of a bound elemental is determined in the same way a new ritual is built.  It will be a negotiation between the DM and the player.  The DM is recommended to be cognizant of what he’s giving away.  In a free form system like this, any given decision can easily be considered canon.  The next PC might wonder why he can’t get the same ability.  Some examples of bound elemental abilities are as follows:<br>

(Rank 1 Summon) Fire Sprite - Affect normal files once per day.<br>
(Rank 1 Summon) Glory Sprite - Light 20 ft radius, 10 rounds, once per day<br>
(Rank 3 Summon) Minor Fire Elemental - 2d6 fire bolt, twice per day, 5 ticks<br>
(Rank 4 Summon) Salamander - Make a weapon flaming<br>
(Rank 5 Summon) Water Elemental - Cold Resist 10<br>
(Rank 5 Summon) Earth Elemental - +2 on a weapon or armor<br>
(Rank 7 Summon) Major Air Elemental - Fly 50 ft, at will<br>


			In order to bind a summon into an item, the summon must either go willingly or be dominated.  <br>
			The binding ritual takes 1 day per rank of the summon you are binding.  Any item may be used.  Binding more than 1 summon per item is doable but has an 50% - the caster’s will power of destroying the item.  The chance to blow up the item goes up by 10% for each summon inside.<br>
			NOTE: This ritual may be taken under non general elements; however, then the binding is specific to that element.
			
			</p>
			<p class="tab"><u>Containment Sphere</u><br/>This spell will entrap a dominated or willing outer planar being into a vessel of the casters chosing (i.e. a small bottle, a glass sphere, etc).

			<p class="tab"><u>Containment/Summon Circle</u><br/> This can be drawn using various items. Ash, blood, ink, carved in stone, carved in wood, forged in steel, designed with holly leaves, etc. The material will change the effectiveness of the circle based on the type of the summon. To determine if the circle was made without error, make a willpower check at DC 28. While in the summoning circle, the magic resistance of the outerplanar beings is negated. Once summoned, a creature can try to break out once per day. They make a saving throw against the DC of the circle. Each day they are in the circle, they get an additional +4 to break out.</p>
			<p class="tab"><u>Protection From Scrying</u><br/>This ritual creates 4 stones.  They can be moved as much as the caster likes and they will persist until they are dismissed, dispelled, or they are moved more than willpower feet apart. Anything inside the stones cannot be scried upon.</p>
